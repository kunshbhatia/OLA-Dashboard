## ðŸ“Š Data & Metrics

### Data Source  
- The dataset is expected to be a flat table (e.g., `July` table) containing ride-level records.  
- Key columns include: `Booking_Status`, `Cancel_By_Customer`, `Cancel_By_Driver`, timestamps, ride identifiers, and other ride attributes.

### Sample Metrics  
- **Total Bookings** = COUNTROWS( July )  
- **Cancelled Bookings** = CALCULATE( COUNTROWS( July ), July[Booking_Status] IN { "Canceled_Rides_by_Customer", "Canceled_Rides_by_Driver" } )  
- **Cancellation %** = DIVIDE( [CancelledBookings], [TotalBookings], 0 )
